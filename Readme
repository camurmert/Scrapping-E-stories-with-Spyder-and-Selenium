In this project, a program was built which can extract qualitative values from a well-known e-story web site such as story name and author name by using spiders, XPath queries, and CSS queries.
Scrapy and Selenium are used mainly. In the website, the second element of the browse section is scraped so results can be changeable by the language of your browser.
For example in English adventure is the second element and science fiction is the second element for Turkish.
Additionally, this project was done for just one genre in the browse section and other genres can be added for future studies.


The website: "https://www.wattpad.com"
